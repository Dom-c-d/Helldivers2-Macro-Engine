This program contains macros for various stratagems to use. All macros are contained in the macro_engine.exe program, and you can specify which macro is the one that runs by adding the name of the stratagem as an argument when launching the program.

## Streamdeck How-To

* First, we need to install this plugin from the elgato marketplace: https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/advanced-launcher-d9a289e4-9f61-4613-9f86-0069f5897125
* Once installed, drag in an "Advanced launcher" from this plugin.
* Then, you need to download the .exe file from the releases tab in this repository: https://github.com/TannerReynolds/Helldivers2-Macro-Engine/releases
    * *Alternatively, you can choose to build the exe from the source code yourself.*
* Once downloaded, set the "Application" to the "macro_engine.exe" you just downloaded.
* Check the box at the bottom that says "Run in background" (required to work in-game)
* And finally, type in the stratagem name in the "arguments" section, preceeded by "--"
